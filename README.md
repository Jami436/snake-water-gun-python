# snake-water-gun-python
A simple Python command-line game: Snake, Water, Gun (like Rock, Paper, Scissors).  My first Python mini-project from CodeWithHarry’s course — Snake, Water, Gun game.  Beginner Python project using random module and conditional logic.  Fun Python game to practice logic building — Snake, Water, Gun.
